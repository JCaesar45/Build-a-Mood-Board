# Mood Board React App

## Overview

This project is a React application that builds a **Mood Board** â€” a visual collage of images and text that conveys ideas, goals, or feelings about a specific theme. The app uses reusable React components to create an interactive and styled mood board.

The CSS for styling the mood board is provided. Your task is to create functional React components that render the mood board content dynamically based on props.

---

## Features

* **Reusable `MoodBoardItem` component** that accepts `color`, `image`, and `description` props.
* Each `MoodBoardItem` displays:

  * A container with a background color from the `color` prop.
  * An image element sourced from the `image` prop.
  * A description rendered as a heading from the `description` prop.
* A parent `MoodBoard` component that:

  * Displays a heading titled **Destination Mood Board**.
  * Renders at least three `MoodBoardItem` components with different data.
* Fully responsive and styled according to provided CSS.

---

## Components

### `MoodBoardItem`

* Props:

  * `color` (string): Sets the background color of the item container.
  * `image` (string): URL of the image to display.
  * `description` (string): Text describing the mood board item.
* Structure:

  * Top-level `<div>` with class `mood-board-item` and inline background color.
  * `<img>` with class `mood-board-image` and `src` set to the image prop.
  * `<h3>` with class `mood-board-text` displaying the description.

### `MoodBoard`

* Structure:

  * Top-level `<div>`.
  * `<h1>` with class `mood-board-heading` displaying "Destination Mood Board".
  * A child `<div>` with class `mood-board` containing multiple `MoodBoardItem` components.
* Renders at least three `MoodBoardItem` components with unique props.

      <h3 className="mood-board-text">{description}</h3>
    </div>

// MoodBoard component
export function MoodBoard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className="mood-board-heading">Destination Mood Board</h1>
